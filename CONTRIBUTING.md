I'm working by myself, so I might make branches, I might not. I'd like to eventually get some Github actions going so at least some basic checks & tests run before something gets merged in. I'm going to be working on this quite a bit over the next few months, and then not much at all. I'd like for a year plus to pass between commits and I have a low chance of catastrophically breaking things.
