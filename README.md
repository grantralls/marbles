A P2P web-based board game where you try to move pieces to your home and avoid being sent back home by the other players!

# Codebase
This repo was initialized with [Vite's typescript preact template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-preact-ts). I also added in the following dependencies you'll want to be aware of.

- Vitest
- ThreeJS (Rendering the game)
- PeerJS (P2P network to make this game not need a server)
- Tailwind/Daisy (Utility & Component classes)
